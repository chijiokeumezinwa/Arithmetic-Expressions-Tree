# Arithmetic-Expressions-Tree

Preferably run this program in eclipse or a similar program
 * Also this program only accepts integers, parentheses, and operational symbols
 * Consider the following expression BNF:
<expression>  ::=  <factor>  * <expression>   |   <factor>  /  <expression>   |   <factor>
<factor>  :==  <term> + <factor>  |  <term> - <factor>  |  <term>
<term>  ::=  {  <expression>  }  |  <literal>
<literal>  ::=  0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9

Using recursive descent, and only recursive descent, scan expressions that adhere to this BNF to build their expression tree; write an integer valued function that scans the tree to evaluate the expression represented by the tree.
